5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PAPER:
  • Highlight best-performing variants: rslora (LoRA-only) and mrlora (KD-LoRA)
  • Discuss the performance gap between LoRA-only and KD-LoRA strategies
  • Note model-specific patterns (e.g., DeBERTa shows different ranking)
  • Include cross-model comparison in supplementary material
  • Consider statistical significance given varying completion rates
